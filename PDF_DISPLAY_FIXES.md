# PDF Display Issues - Resolution

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: The `node_modules` directory was empty and all dependencies were missing
- **Fix**: Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all required packages

### 2. **Version Conflicts Between PDF Libraries**
- **Problem**: Incompatible versions between `pdfjs-dist` (v5.3.31) and `@react-pdf-viewer` packages (expecting v2.x-3.x)
- **Fix**: 
  - Downgraded `pdfjs-dist` from `^5.3.31` to `^3.11.174`
  - Downgraded `react-pdf` from `^10.0.1` to `^7.7.3`
  - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve peer dependency conflicts

### 3. **Inconsistent PDF.js Worker Configuration**
- **Problem**: Three different worker configurations across components:
  - `Document.jsx`: Used unpkg CDN URL
  - `Scanner.jsx`: Used cdnjs CDN URL  
  - `ScannedDocumentCard.jsx`: Used local worker with .mjs extension
- **Fix**: Standardized all components to use the same local worker configuration:
  ```javascript
  pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL(
      "pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js",
      import.meta.url
  ).toString();
  ```

### 4. **Missing Error Handling**
- **Problem**: No error logging for PDF load failures
- **Fix**: Added `onLoadError` handlers to all Document components with console error logging

### 5. **Build Configuration**
- **Problem**: PDF worker not properly bundled during build
- **Fix**: The build now correctly includes the PDF worker file (`pdf.worker.min-DKQKFyKK.js`)

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/package.json**: Updated PDF library versions
2. **frontend/src/components/pdf_show/Document.jsx**: Fixed worker config and added error handling
3. **frontend/src/components/Scanner.jsx**: Fixed worker configuration
4. **frontend/src/components/ScannedDocumentCard.jsx**: Fixed worker config and added error handling
5. **frontend/src/components/PDFTest.jsx**: Created test component with sample PDF

## Testing

Created a test component (`PDFTest.jsx`) that uses a base64-encoded sample PDF to verify:
- PDF.js worker loading
- Document rendering
- Error handling
- Console logging

## Current Status

✅ Dependencies installed successfully
✅ Version conflicts resolved
✅ Worker configuration standardized  
✅ Error handling added
✅ Build completes successfully
✅ Test component created

The PDF display functionality should now work correctly. If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Verify the backend is serving files from the `/uploads` directory
3. Ensure PDF files exist and are accessible via the correct URLs
4. Test with the PDFTest component first to isolate issues
